 Assessment of cs56-android-getting-started
 
 a) Description:

A CS56 project/tutorial for getting started with Android Programming. The tutorial takes you through the following:
 1. Setting Up Android Studio
 2. Anatomy of a Basic Android App
 3. Building your first Android App
 4. Intro to Services and Broadcast Recievers
 5. Credits & Extra Links

This project also contains a tutorial for how to build tutorials in Github and links to companion apps/projects. 

b) User Stories:
 
As a user of cs56-android-getting-started we learned how to download, install, and set-up Android studio. We were also able to set-up/manage Android emulation and set-up my phone for testing an application in step 1. In step 2 we were taught the structure and internal workings of an Android activity specifically the manifest file, layout and service. In step 3 we were taken through the steps of building a simple Android app. We started a new project, debugged, and wrote the code for a simple application that can help people figure out whether a number is prime or not. In step 4 we learned the basics of service and broadcast reciever components and how to add the code for these components for an application. In step 5 we are provided with tips, tools and links to other tutorials to assist in future android programming. 

 c) Brief assessment of whether the software runs:
 
 There is no software for the cs56-android-getting-started project, the project consists of a tutorial on github for basic android programming in which you build a simple Android app. The application we created, which lets a user input a number and returns whether the number is prime or not, runs.

d) Features that could be added:

Tutorials for simple graphics/animation, saving the state of an application, and for integrating an app with a social media service.

e) Assessment of the README:

Currently, the README only contains a one sentence description of the project and links to the tutorial index, how to build a github tutorial, and to a companion smoke signal application. To improve the quality of the README we could indicate how to install Android Studio for Windows, Linux and Mac. We can also put the source for the simplest Android Studio project that could possibly do anything useful into this repo and add instructions to the README on how to git clone it, load it up in Android Studio, compile, and then load either into an Android phone or an emulator. 

f) Assesment of the build.xml file :

The current build.xml file is fine. There aren't any targets missing descrptions, and there doesn't seem to be any old JWS stuff that needs to be removed.

g) Assessment of the current “issues”:

Definitely, there are more than 1000 points. Cleaning up the source code is worth 300 points. Fixing the client to properly turn on is worth 100 points. Turning the command line menu into a GUI is worth 200 points. Adding a visual indicator for the beats is worth 300 points. Adding a clear all button for the checkboxes is worth 150 points, and bumped up to 200 points if a reset tempo button is added. This already surpasses 1000 points.

h) Aditional issues:

1. Add option to dynamically update the sound [Link To Issue](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-music-beatbox/issues/20 "Add option to Dynamically update the sound")

i) Assessment of the actual code:

The purposes of the classes and the methods are very clear, as the follow the beat box example in Head First Java. There are both code and javadoc comments that further clarify the methods as well. There are only two classes, a BeatBoxFinal class and a MusicServer class, and their relations are straightforward. The BeatBoxFinal class sets up the GUI and handles the beat box, while the Music Server class is only called to establish a connection to a server if the user desires to play online. The code is also extremely clear, albeit a few strange spacing issues (for example, in the integer array for the instruments, some of the numbers are seperated by a comma and a space, while some are only seperated by a comma). Every task is handled in a way that makes it clear to the code reader why the actions are being taken. If we had to give a programmer a screenful of text, we would give them the portion of the BeatBoxFinal class that sets up the GUI, and handles ActionEvents, as this is the most important part of the code (it actually makes the checkboxes and buttons do things).

j) Test Coverage:

There is no test coverage, thus there are plenty of opportunities to expand the test coverage. An opportunity to expand test coverage would be to test if the server is able to connect to the CSIL server and if the client is able to connect online to this server. Other tests to implement would be exception testing, as the rest of the tests (for example, checking if an instrument's checkbox actually puts in the correct beat at the correct time) can be done by simply running the program and testing it real time.
