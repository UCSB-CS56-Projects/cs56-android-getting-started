 Assessment of cs56-android-getting-started
 
 a) Description:

A CS56 project/tutorial for getting started with Android Programming. The tutorial takes you through the following:
 1. Setting Up Android Studio
 2. Anatomy of a Basic Android App
 3. Building your first Android App
 4. Intro to Services and Broadcast Recievers
 5. Credits & Extra Links

This project also contains a tutorial for how to build tutorials in Github and links to companion apps/projects. 

b) User Stories:
 
As a user of cs56-android-getting-started we learned how to download, install, and set-up Android studio. We were also able to set-up/manage Android emulation and set-up my phone for testing an application in step 1. In step 2 we were taught the structure and internal workings of an Android activity specifically the manifest file, layout and service. In step 3 we were taken through the steps of building a simple Android app. We started a new project, debugged, and wrote the code for a simple application that can help people figure out whether a number is prime or not. In step 4 we learned the basics of service and broadcast reciever components and how to add the code for these components for an application. In step 5 we are provided with tips, tools, and links to other tutorials to assist in future android programming. 

 c) Brief assessment of whether the software runs:
 
 There is no software for the cs56-android-getting-started project, the project consists of a tutorial on github for basic android programming in which you build a simple Android app. The application we created, which lets a user input a number and returns whether the number is prime or not, runs.

d) Features that could be added:

Tutorials for simple graphics/animation, saving the state of an application, and for integrating an app with a social media service.

e) Assessment of the README:

Currently, the README only contains a one sentence description of the project and links to the tutorial index, how to build a github tutorial, and to a companion smoke signal application. To improve the quality of the README we could indicate how to install Android Studio for Windows, Linux and Mac. We can also put the source for the simplest Android Studio project that could possibly do anything useful into this repo and add instructions to the README on how to git clone it, load it up in Android Studio, compile, and then load either into an Android phone or an emulator. 

f) Assesment of the build.xml file :

There isn't a build.xml file for this project.

g) Assessment of the current “issues”:

There are more than 1000 points for this project. We can get 100 points for each simple companion app (w/ tutorial) we create. By adding the features talked about in part d of this assessment and by improving the readme we can earn more than 1000 points. 

h) Additional issues:

We did not add any issues, however we are going to add an issue once we decide what companion app we wish to build a tutorial for.

i) Assessment of the tutorial/code:

The steps of this project are very clear and we were able to follow and understand the tutorial with ease. The main index and indexes for each step are short and concise. Each step is layed out clearly and has visuals to assist the user. The important terms dealing with Android programming have straightforward descriptions and their are links for almost every aspect described which allow the user to further their understanding of an aspect if necessary. If we had to give a programmer a screenful of text, we would give them the description of a manifest file, as the manifest presents essential information about your app to the Android system (information the system must have before it can run any of the app's code). Also, the code of the simple application in the tutorial is very clear (with notes explaining each function) and organized for the user to understand easily.


j) Test Coverage:

The tutorial explains the basics of debugging/testing with Android DDMS and the use of "Visual Debugging" (Toasts). There is room to further the tutorial for debugging as the tutorial only explains debugging briefly. A seperate debugging tutorial could be added to the project.
