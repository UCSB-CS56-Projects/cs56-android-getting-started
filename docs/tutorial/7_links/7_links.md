##Extra Links

You probably already have a ton of interesting ideas that you want to test out on Android. If you don't then consider that a Android phones tend to have anything from GPS, Accelerometer, Mobile Interface, NFC, Bluetooth, Cameras, Multi-touch screens, Speakers, and a bunch of other things. Add to that the fact that a bunch of other devices (e.g TVs, Glasses, Watches, even Refrigerators!) are using Android. Just let that stew in for a while and I'm sure you will quickly start thinking about all the crazy cool stuff you can build.  Here are some good links that will help you jumpstart your project.
