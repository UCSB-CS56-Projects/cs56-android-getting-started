<h2 id="2_objective">Objective</h2>
The objective for this tutorial is to save and restore the activity state of the app created in the previous tutorial. We will build on the basic principles of android development and GUI building to increase your comfort using Android Studio and coding for Android devices.

<h2 id="2_starting">Managing the Activity Lifestyle</h2>
Managing the lifecycle of your activities by implementing callback methods is crucial to developing a strong and flexible application. The lifecycle of an activity is directly affected by its association with other activities, its task and back stack.

An activity can exist in essentially three states:

- Resumed:
    - The activity is in the foreground of the screen and has user focus. (This state is also sometimes referred to as "running".)
- Paused:
    - Another activity is in the foreground and has focus, but this one is still visible. That is, another activity is visible on top of this one and that activity is partially transparent or doesn't cover the entire screen. A paused activity is completely alive (the Activity object is retained in memory, it maintains all state and member information, and remains attached to the window manager), but can be killed by the system in extremely low memory situations.
- Stopped:
    - The activity is completely obscured by another activity (the activity is now in the "background"). A stopped activity is also still alive (the Activity object is retained in memory, it maintains all state and member information, but is not attached to the window manager). However, it is no longer visible to the user and it can be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.

When an activity is paused or stopped, the state of the activity is retained because the Activity object is still held in memory and all information about its members and current state is still alive. Thus, any changes the user made within the activity are retained so that when the activity returns to the foreground (when it "resumes"), those changes are still there.

However, when the system destroys an activity in order to recover memory, the Activity object is destroyed, so the system cannot simply resume it with its state intact. Instead, the system must recreate the Activity object if the user navigates back to it. Yet, the user is unaware that the system destroyed the activity and recreated it and, thus, probably expects the activity to be exactly as it was. In this situation, you can ensure that important information about the activity state is preserved by implementing an additional callback method that allows you to save information about the state of your activity: onSaveInstanceState().

The system calls onSaveInstanceState() before making the activity vulnerable to destruction. The system passes this method a Bundle in which you can save state information about the activity as name-value pairs, using methods such as putString() and putInt(). Then, if the system kills your application process and the user navigates back to your activity, the system recreates the activity and passes the Bundle to both onCreate() and onRestoreInstanceState(). Using either of these methods, you can extract your saved state from the Bundle and restore the activity state. If there is no state information to restore, then the Bundle passed to you is null (which is the case when the activity is created for the first time).

-**Note:** There's no guarantee that onSaveInstanceState() will be called before your activity is destroyed, because there are cases in which it won't be necessary to save the state (such as when the user leaves your activity using the Back button, because the user is explicitly closing the activity). If the system calls onSaveInstanceState(), it does so before onStop() and possibly before onPause().

The default implementation calls the corresponding onSaveInstanceState() method for every View in the layout, which allows each view to provide information about itself that should be saved. Almost every widget in the Android framework implements this method as appropriate, such that any visible changes to the UI are automatically saved and restored when your activity is recreated. For example, the EditText widget saves any text entered by the user and the CheckBox widget saves whether it's checked or not. 

Although the default implementation of onSaveInstanceState() saves useful information about your activity's UI, you still might need to override it to save additional information. For example, you might need to save member values that changed during the activity's life (which might correlate to values restored in the UI, but the members that hold those UI values are not restored, by default). Because the default implementation of onSaveInstanceState() helps save the state of the UI, if you override the method in order to save additional state information, you should always call the superclass implementation of onSaveInstanceState() before doing any work. Likewise, you should also call the superclass implementation of onRestoreInstanceState() if you override it, so the default implementation can restore view states.

- **Note:** Because onSaveInstanceState() is not guaranteed to be called, you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity (the state of the UI)â€”you should never use it to store persistent data. Instead, you should use onPause() to store persistent data (such as data that should be saved to a database) when the user leaves the activity. In this tutorial we will record the transient state of the activity.

A good way to test your application's ability to restore its state is to rotate the device so that the screen orientation changes. When the screen orientation changes, the system destroys and recreates the activity in order to apply alternative resources that might be available for the new screen configuration. For this reason alone, it's very important that your activity completely restores its state when it is recreated, because users regularly rotate the screen while using applications



<h2 id="2_usingAS">Using Android Studio</h2>

Android Studio is based of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It is an Integrated Development Studio (IDE) that essentially organizes together all the possible tools you will need while developing. It has integrated debugging, gradle (and maven) support, commandline execution, Android Device Debugging and bunch of other things that will make programming for Android a breeze. 

First let's look at the basic layout of Android Studio: *(Maybe you dont see panel 3 or 4, but don't worry we'll explain how to get them soon)*

![Taken from KonukoII](2_android_studio.png)
- **(1) File editor:** As you can imagine, this is the place where you can edit your project files. *On top you can see different tabs for opened documents, and atop that you can see their location within the project.*
- **(2)Project Navigator:** Here you can explore the files within your project.*(Access Hotkey: ALT+1 or use the 1:Project)* 
- **(3) Android DDMS:** Here you can see debugging/log information from either your phone or emulator *(Access Hotkey: ALT+6 or use the 6:Android button)* 
- **(4) Event Log:** This panel shows an event log of things like compiling, running, or errors.*(Accessible by clicking on the Event Log button)*
- **(5) Background Tasks:** Shows you which tasks are happening right now (e.g compiling, uploading app to android phone/emulator, memory tracking, etc.)
- **(6) Run and Debug:** These are the main buttons for running & debugging.
- **(7) ADV and SDK:** These buttons bring up the ADK and SDK managers.


<h2 id="2_testing">Testing and Running</h2>

Congratulations! at this point you have a fully functional Android app that displays a simple activity with a "hello world!" label. Woot! At this point you should consider testing your app and make sure that everything works fine. You will probably be running and testing your app a bunch of times during the development of your app, so you want to make sure you know how to do this.

<h4>Running the app</h4>

First please make sure that you set-up Android Studio with either the necessary emulator or android device requirements (depending on what you are going to use)

Hit the **Run** button *(Hotkey: ALT+F10)*
Then choose either **A running device** *(android physical device)* or **Launch Emulator**.
![Taken from KonukoII](2_launch.png)

Afterwards the program will compile and run on your chosen device.

<h4>Debugging with Android DDMS</h4>

Android ships with a debugging tool called the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS), which provides port-forwarding services, screen capture on the device, thread and heap information on the device, logcat, process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location data spoofing, and more.

While you can do a bunch of stuff with it, we are only going to show you how to do system print statements, so that you can debug your code just like you are used to.

In android, to do a print statement that appears in the DDMS console, you first need to `import android.util.Log` and then you can simply call:

```Java
//You can use tags to identify the source of the message (class or method)

Log.d("TAG","Some Message"); //d for Debugging
Log.e("TAG","Some Message"); //e for Error
Log.i("TAG","Some Message"); //i for info
Log.w("TAG","Some Message"); //w for warning
Log.wtf("TAG","Some Message"); //wtf for....."What a Terrible Failure"
```

Most likely though, you will simply end up using `Log.d(tag,message)` and its all good!

<h4>"Visual Debugging"</h4>

Although they aren't technically for debugging, you can use Toasts *(These are little messages that will pop on the actual screen)* for quick debugging. 

To use them first ```import android.widget.Toast``` and then you can call it by ```Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, text, duration);```

In the case of this tutorial: *Context* is going to be the MainActivity so we can simply call: ```Toast.makeText(this,"Some Message!",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();```

<h2 id="2_layout">Setting up a Simple Layout</h2>

	
**Understanding the Layout Builder Screen**

![Taken from KonukoII](2_layout_explain.png)

- **(1) UI Preview Screen:** This is the main screen where you can drag-and-drop widgets and other GUI objects.
- **(2) Palette: ** From here you can select any widget or UI object and drop it into the Preview Screen. *(Hint: deprecated objects will show up striked-out)*
- **(3) Component Tree:** Shows the different UI objects and hierarchy among them.
- **(4) Properties:** Once you select a UI object from the layout *(either by clicking on it on the Preview screen or the Component Tree)* you can change it's properties.
- **(5) Design/Text Tabs:** You can quickly change from the GUI previewer to the the actual code with these tabs.

**Building the basic Layout for our Project**
Start by drag-and-dropping:
- **1 Large Text :** We are going to make this a simple title explaining the app's purpose in life.
- **1 Text Field (Number):** The field were we are going to judge the number to be a worthy prime or simply a regular composite number. Note: The nice thing about choosing the text field to be of type (Number) is that it restricts what the user can put into it by only providing a numerical keyboard when the user trys to input anything.
- **1 Button:** The button we are going to click to decide the fate of the number we want to test
- **1 Medium Text:** Where we are going to output the final decision, a strong "Yay!" if it's prime or a "Nay!" if it is not prime.

Feel free to put them in any particular place that you want. Overall it will look something like:

<h2 id="2_programming">Coding the App</h2>

<h4>Importing the necessary libraries</h4>

So before we start, the libraries you will need to import are:
*(Put this on top of your MainActivity java class)*
```Java
import android.view.View;	//For our button callback function's parameters
import android.widget.Toast; //For 'visual debugging' on phone
import android.util.Log; //For actual debugging
```

<h4>Renaming the UI objects</h4>

Each object in our UI layout has a set of properties. This properties describe the element's behavior and look. There are two ways of changing an elements properties.

- Declare the property in the XML (This is a good way of setting default properties or properties that you know will not be changed, such as a button text.)
	- With Android's UI designer you can simply select a UI object and change it's properties on the **Properties** panel.
	- *Pro Tip: double clicking on a UI object will allow you to quickly change its ID or Name*
	
	Changing the text of a button (wether you do it on the UI editor or directly with code) will end up looking like:
	
	```Java
	<Button
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/button"
        android:layout_centerVertical="true"
        android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
        android:text="Click Me!"	//<--- What the button will display as text
        android:nestedScrollingEnabled="false"/>
    ```
- Change it during runtime with code in your Activity. (This is similar to what you do when building UIs with the Java AWT or Swing Libraries.)
	This would look like:
	```Java
	Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button); // First Find it in the Layout
	btn.setText("Click Me!");
	```

Knowing this, feel free to change the UI elements to display them the way you want. Otherwise we suggest using the previous photo as reference.
- **Note:** that for the **Text Fields** there is a property called **Hint** which is the shaded text that disappears as soon as the user starts to input something into the field. This is completely different from **Text**.

<h4>Adding a callback function for our button</h4>
First thing we need to do is code our button so that when it gets clicked we call a function. For this we will need to change the button's **'onClick'** property. 

Now that you know how to change an UI object's properties you can choose to declare the button callback function however you want.

- **Option 1:** Declare it on the Layout XML
	- So wherever you have your button declared, you would just add `android:onClick="test_prime"`. 
	- Meanwhile  on the mainActivity *(or whatever activity is actually showing implementing this Layout)* we will code a testPrime function `public void test_prime(View view){/*Do something*/;}`
	Button Callback test_prime **must** functions have to be **public void** that take a **View** parameter.

- **Option 2:** Declare it directly on the code (at the MainActivity class)
	```Java
	Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);
	btn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
	    public void test_prime(View v) {
	    	// Do something
	    }
	});	
	```
	
<h4>Coding the 'test_prime' function</h4>

Using the previous concepts and ideas we can quickly build a simple function that not only tests for primes but also The following is going to be the test_prime function.

Most of the code is pretty self explanatory, notice that the main thing when working with UI elements is to first find them using something similar to: `Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);` and then using methods `btn.foo(x,y,z)`.

Each UI element has multiple different method types. You can find out the specifics for each one at the [Android Developer Site](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/index.html)


```Java
//Button Callback Function//
public void test_prime(View view){

    //1. GET INPUT
    TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.editText); //Obtain the TextView element where the user provides the input
    String str = textView.getText().toString(); //Get the text currently assigned to this input. (Since it is of inputType number we are assured that there will only be pos ints)

    //2. TEST INPUT
    if (!str.isEmpty()) { //Check that there is input
        Log.d("test_prime","Testing number"+str);
        int i = Integer.parseInt(str); //Turn the string into an int.

        //2.1 TEST PRIMENESS
        boolean prime = isPrime(i);

        //2.2 REPORT THE RESULT
        TextView textView2 = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView2);

        if (prime) {textView2.setText(i + " is a prime");}
        else { textView2.setText(i + " is not a prime");}

        Log.d("test_prime",i+" -> prime:"+(boolean)prime);

    } else{//The user could have pressed the button without providing any number.
        Log.d("test_prime","No number was provided");
        Toast.makeText(this,"No number provided",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}
```
As for the isPrime() function we have a simple algorithm to figure out primeness.
```Java
//Tests if a number is prime//
private boolean isPrime(int i){
    boolean flag = true; //All inputs are considered prime until proven composite

    if (i < 2){ flag = false;} //0,1 are not primes
    else if (i == 2){ flag = true;} //2 is the only even prime
    else if ((i%2)==0){flag = false;} //Other multiple of 2 are not primes
    else {  //Odd numbers, we must check by bruteforce.
        for (int k = 3; k < Math.sqrt(i); k=k+2) {
            if (i%k==0){ flag = false;}    //if i is a multiple of some k number, then it is not a prime
        }
    }
    return flag;
}
```

That's all there really is to it. You just built a simple program that can help people figure out whether a number is prime or not. Wee! Now it is time for you to venture into more complex projects.
